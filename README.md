# -The-Machine_learning-Projects-
The "The Machine_learning: Projects" repository is a collection of projects pertaining to many facets of machine learning, such as feature engineering, model selection, data cleaning, pre-processing,Â and evaluation. In order to give users real-world examples they can use to learn about and experiment with machine learning, each project in the repository is created to highlight a particular machine learning method or application. Each project includes all the required files and instructions to recreate the results, and the code is organised in a simple and understandable manner.
